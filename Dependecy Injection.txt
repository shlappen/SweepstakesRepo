Passing the ISweepstakesManager interface into the constructor of MarketingFirm allows us to avoid having to write conditional logic to determine which ISweepstakesManager to instantiate/use.  Dependency injection facilitates adherence to the open closed principle by allowing us to extend code without having to modify existing code.  For example, in this case we could add another Sweepstakes Manager without having to change the MarketingFirm class.  Also please note that generally I would have more commits but I often do not get WiFi where I sit in class.
